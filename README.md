# num-methods
## Introduction

I am just writing this as an example for some friends of mine.

For this I am using a combination of C/C++ as I am trying to explain
what is going on and the audience (some of my friends) have a easier
time of understanding straight C code than C++.

Of course, to convert to C++ is straight forward as any function
which has a structure as a parameter (usually the first parameter)
is a method of that class.
